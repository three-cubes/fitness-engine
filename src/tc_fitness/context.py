"""Shared per-run state for the in-process fitness runner.

Motivation
----------
A catalogue-driven runner that spawns one cold subprocess per rule re-parses
the same source trees dozens of times — every AST-based check re-``ast.parse``s
the files it walks, and every process re-imports the check library. The
dominant cost of a full run is cold-start + redundant parsing.

:class:`CheckContext` is built ONCE per process and shared across every
in-process check:

* a ``python_files(*roots)`` index — each relevant tree is ``rglob``-d once;
* an ``ast.parse`` cache keyed by ``(filename, source-text)`` so every file is
  parsed AT MOST ONCE per run, no matter how many rules inspect it;
* an ``ast.walk`` cache keyed by tree identity so a parsed tree is traversed
  once and the node list shared;
* a source-text cache for the regex / text checks.

Parse-once mechanism
--------------------
Rather than thread a context object through every AST call site (high blast
radius, high risk of a verdict-changing edit), :meth:`install` swaps
``ast.parse`` / ``ast.walk`` for memoising wrappers for the lifetime of an
in-process run. The cache key for parsing is ``(filename, source-text)``:
identical source for the same file yields the identical tree, and the checks
only ever read / walk trees (never mutate them), so sharing one parsed tree
across rules is observably identical to re-parsing. The real functions are
restored on context exit, so the patch never leaks past a run.

The cache key folds in the source TEXT (not just a stat) so a file edited
mid-run — or two distinct files that happen to share a stat — can never serve
a stale tree.
